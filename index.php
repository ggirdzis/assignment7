    <p2>Welcome to <span class="site">Live UVM</span>! My name is Gretchen and I am currently finishing my freshman year of college at the University of Vermont. I want to share my journey as well as provide a guide to incoming freshmen next semester. I'm here to answer questions and give advice to help make the most out of that memorable first year of school at UVM! Feel free to send questions through <a href="">Ask a Question</a>. </p2>
